Simplified Explanation
======================

Neural response data from 27 conditions.  Data are given from 49 different
neurons at 422 time points, spaced 5ms apart.

For a particular neuron and condition, the experiment is as follows:

1. At time t=0ms, start recording neural activity in the monkey.
2. At time t=400ms (`TARGET-ON`), show the monkey a target.  The monkey is not
     allowed to move at this point.
3. At a random time between time t=400ms and time t=1560ms, allow the monkey 
     to move.
4. At time t=1560ms (`MOVEMENT`), the monkey starts to move and point at the 
     target.
5. Record activity up to but not including time t=2110ms. 

Each condition includes a target position and a configuration of obstacles. 
The same monkey is used for every trial.


Caveats
-------

1. In reality, neural activity is binary `ON`/`OFF`. The `ON` spikes are 
   modeled as a point process with time-varying intensity. To estimate this 
   intensity, each condition is repeated about 20 times. The spike trains get 
   convolved with a Gaussian kernel and then averaged.  The bandwidth of
   the kernel is hand-selected.

2. The `TARGET-ON` and `MOVEMENT` times are randomized across conditions.  To 
   register the events at t=400ms and t=1560ms, the neural activity
   time series get manually cut up into three segments and then interpolated.
   
3. The response from each neuron gets scaled so that the range of the response
   values across all conditions is 1.0.  Each neuron has a different scaling, 
   but the same scaling gets used for each condition.


Column Descriptions
===================

The data is stored in the file "motor.csv".  This can be read into R
using the command `read.csv("motor.csv")`.  The columns are as follows:

* neuron    - the integer id of the neuron (1 - 49).

* condition - the integer id of the condition (1 - 27).

* time      - the time point, in ms.  The values are evenly spaced in the
              range [0,2110), with a gap of 5ms between each time point.
              The values are { 0, 5, 10, ..., 2100, 2105 }.

* response  - the neural response.  In theory, these values should all be 
              non-negative.  The negative values are presumably from round-off 
              errors in the initial data-processing phase.

There are 49 * 27 * 422 = 558306 total rows.
